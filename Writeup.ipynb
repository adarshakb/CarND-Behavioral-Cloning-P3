    "\n",
    "### Model Architecture and Training Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Solution Design Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall strategy for deriving a model architecture was to have a simple Conv network which can learn and generalize.I didnot want to use any existing architectures and wanted to find a simpler one. Many people have got good results with VGG and comma.ai architecture. I took insipiration from these and stripped down the networks to have less parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "My first step was to use a convolution neural network model similar to the VGG. I thought this model might be appropriate because my peers have had success. Also there are easily available pretrainined networks. However I quickly realized that the model is too complex for the limited amount of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "I used UDACITY's provided data. However i found that this didnot handle well corners. So I collected my own data for corners and recovery in different sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to gauge how well the model was working, I split my image and steering angle data into a training and validation set. \n",
    "\n",
    "To combat the overfitting, I modified the model so that it has Lamda which normalizes input & drop outs & RLU for complex function\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step was to run the simulator to see how well the car was driving around track one. There were a few spots where the vehicle fell off the track... to improve the driving behavior in these cases, I collected more data in recovery for sharp turns if vehical goes out.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the process, the vehicle is able to drive autonomously around the track without leaving the road.\n",
